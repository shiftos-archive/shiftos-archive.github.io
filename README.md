# ShiftOS archive

ShiftOS was a game originally developed by Australian YouTuber 
"OSFirstTimer," otherwise known as Philip Adams. The game's development 
started in 2013 and ended in August of 2017. During that time, there 
were at least 4 official major rewrites of the game and dozens of 
community-created rewrites, clones and ShiftOS-likes.

Although the various rewrites had slightly different designs in relation 
to each other, the core gameplay stayed the same - perform actions in an 
experimental operating system, earn points for those actions, and use 
them to buy new features and programs for the OS.

The game was never finished/fully released. Although there were many 
stable releases of the game, they were never considered "finished." This 
archive serves as a place to host and preserve as much of the game's 
history as possible, for those interested. This includes source code, 
skins, binary releases, and more.
